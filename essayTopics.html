					<li data-theme="b">How are the author's political beliefs represented in the novel?</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The Jungle was not just intended to inform readers about the horrible truth of the meat packing industry, it was also a way for Sinclair to push his Socialist beliefs upon the reader.
					<li data-theme="c">Throughout the novel Sinclair develops the character of Jurgis as someone the reader can sympathize for by taking a man searching for the American dream and pushing him into the horrible nightmare of Capitalism.
					<li data-theme="d">After showing the horrors of what Capitalism can bring about, Sinclair then offers the idea of Socialism.
					<li data-theme="c">He does this by having Jurgis being introduced to the idea accidentally, and falling in love with it.
					<li data-theme="d">The idea then transforms Jurgis' life as all of the sudden he is not a poor wreck waiting for death, but a motivated man working to make a difference for the common man.
					<li data-theme="c">The novel shows Socialism as spreading very rapidly after Jurgis' initial introduction to it, and seemingly sweeping the country making life much better for everyone.
					<li data-theme="d">When looking at the novel as a whole, it is clear that the story has nothing to do with Jurgis' story, but instead was written to provide an easier outlet to push the Socialist idea by making it out to be the savior to a horrible Capitalistic system.</li>

					<li data-theme="b">Do the completely packed stockyards of animals represent anything in the novel?</li>
					<li data-theme="d"><li data-theme="c">The stockyards of animals are very similar to the meatpacking industry as a whole.
					<li data-theme="c">In the stockyards animals are packed so close they cannot move, they are not separated even if they are diseased, and they are kept smashed together in the stockyard until it is their time to die.
					<li data-theme="d">The common people working in the meatpacking industry are also in a similar situation.
					<li data-theme="c">They are stuck working a job they cannot leave, as leaving would mean unemployment and homelessness.
					<li data-theme="d">The job is extremely harmful to their health.
					<li data-theme="c">They are treated as if they are beneath normal humans, and are replaceable.
					<li data-theme="d">The workers basically live to serve the meat packing industry.
					<li data-theme="c">And lastly they will all eventually succumb to death without ever escaping the harsh lifestyle of the industry.
					<li data-theme="d">In the eyes of the industry executives, the humans and animals are no different, they just serve a different role in reaching the same outcome, easy profit.</li>
